# Checklist

### Kubernetes Host Requirements

This will run on just about any Linux OS, if you aren't following the guide then it would require some initial research to get all the right components installed.

### Full network connectivity

Lets go ahead and make this easier on ourselves to search for each node, we will configure DNS locally, in a production environment you won't have to do this.

We will go with this naming of the servers 

```text
control-plane
worker-1
worker-2
```
